### research

## New Markdown
Some latex  $$ \alpha - \beta = \gamma $$.

My research triangulates between applied mathematics, computational biology and theoretical neuroscience. The central motivation of my PhD project is to understand and develop fundamental theory for learning and control in biological agents subject to normative constraints from physiology and evolution.

### tmorville.github.io
The intention of this website is a platform to share streamlined [notes and code]({{ site.url }}/projects) while playing a bit of research catch-up or just exploring interesting projects. I am widely interested in implementation of deep learning, control theory, reinforcement learning, computational neuroscience and applied mathematics.
