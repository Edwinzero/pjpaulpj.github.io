## The Alcohol Ban and Crime figures in Bihar

Alcohol ban in bihar. Reception at the time. 

### The tide turns
A few days back, a couple of newspapers carried a report on how crime rates in Bihar had increased steadily following the alcohol ban. I found this puzzling and decided to dig in deep. 

The key claim of rising crime post the April ban of alcohol was the following graph, generated from figures obtained from the Bihar police.

## More data
We can't be sure if the rise in crimes we're seeing is not entirely out of the usual trend- perhaps in Bihar, over the year April-October is indeed a period of rising crime? To verify this I prepared the following graphs of crime by each month.
