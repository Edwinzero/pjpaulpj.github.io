## The Alcohol Ban and Crime figures in Bihar

Alcohol ban in Bihar. Reception at the time. 

### The tide turns
A few days back, a couple of newspapers carried a report based on this [article](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/270-days-after-bihar-liquor-ban-major-crimes-up-13-40759) about how crime rates in Bihar had increased steadily following the alcohol ban. I found this puzzling and decided to dig in deep. 

The key claim of rising crime post the April ban of alcohol was the following graph, generated from figures obtained from the Bihar police. The author compared the total crime figure of 14,279 in April, 2016 to 16,153 in October, 2016 to arrive at a difference of around 13% which was recorded as the increase in crime post the alcohol ban.

Before we rule this shift as the result of the alcohol ban, we need to have a sense of what the crime figures for October, 2016 would have been if the ban had not happened. A rough and dirty method to get this sense is to look at how crime figures in Bihar behaved before the ban.

## Seasonality of crimes
We can't be sure if the rise in crimes we're seeing is not entirely out of the usual trend- perhaps in Bihar, over the year April-October is indeed a period of rising crime? In other words, crime in Bihar could be season- increasing in one month, falling in other. 

 To verify this I prepared the following graphs of crime by each month.
