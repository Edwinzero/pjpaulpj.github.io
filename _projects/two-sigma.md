### An attempt to implement information theoretical _redundancy_ for the [Two Sigma finansial time-series data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling) from Kaggle. Following [Joshua Garland, Ryan James, and Elizabeth Bradley](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052910) _redundancy_ is established as _weighted permutation entropy_.
