My research triangulates between applied mathematics, computational biology and theoretical decision-making. The central motivation of my PhD project is to develop and improve a fundamental theory of choice based subject to normative constraints from physiology and evolution. Through my PhD Iâ€™ve tested the predictions from this theory via axiomatic methods using behavioural and neural measurement using magnetic resonance (in humans), optogenetics, and fibre optometry (in mice).
