### research
My research triangulates between applied mathematics, computational biology and theoretical neuroscience. The central motivation of my PhD project is to understand and develop fundamental theory for learning and control in biological agents subject to normative constraints from physiology and evolution.  This implies a deep understanding of optimal control theory and its etiological derivatives (reinforcement learning, utility theory) and recent advances in approximate inference.

The intention of this website is a platform to share [streamlined notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) and [code]({{ site.url }}/projects) while playing a bit of research catch-up. I am widely interested in implementation of deep learning, control theory and reinforcement learning.
