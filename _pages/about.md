### Work
I work as an Associate with [IDinsight](http://idinsight.org/). I'm currently stationed in Andhra Pradesh, India, evaluating the impact of a integrated agricultural extension programme.


### Life
I try to read, and write about what I read. Some of that finds its way here. I trek, lift, and bike.
